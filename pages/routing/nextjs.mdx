### Route Configuration

Using a file-system-based router, Next.js allows for:

Routes are defined using folders. A route is a single path made up of nested folders that follows the file-system hierarchy from the root folder all the way down to the leaf folder that contains the _`page.js`_ file. Check out Defining Routes.

The user interface (UI) displayed for a route segment is made using files. View the unique files.

For better understanding, please read the nextjs routing documentation:

### How to add a new page?

Inside the `app folder`, make a new folder, and inside that folder, make a file _`page.jsx.`_

```js app/about/page.jsx
const About = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is About Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```
