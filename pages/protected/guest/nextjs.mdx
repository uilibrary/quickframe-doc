### How to work ?

Sometimes you may want to make certain routes, such as /register, /login, etc., only accessible to users who are not authenticated. You can use the _`GuestGuard`_ component to direct users to a specific route/page (/dashboard) by using it.

```js GuestGuard.jsx
"use client";

import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import useAuth from "hooks/useAuth";

const GuestGuard = ({ children }) => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isAuthenticated) router.replace("/dashboard");
  }, [isAuthenticated]);

  return <>{children}</>;
};

export default GuestGuard;
```

### How to use it ?

```js layout.jsx
import { GuestGuard } from "components/auth";

const AuthLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return <GuestGuard>{children}</GuestGuard>;
};

export default AuthLayout;
```
