### How to work ?

Sometimes you may want to make certain routes, such as /register, /login, etc., only accessible to users who are not authenticated. You can use the _`GuestGuard`_ component to direct users to a specific route/page (/dashboard) by using it.

```js GuestGuard.jsx
import { Navigate, useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
import useAuth from "hooks/useAuth";

const GuestGuard = ({ children }) => {
  const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth();

  if (isAuthenticated) {
    return <Navigate to="/dashboard" />;
  }

  return <Fragment>{children || <Outlet />}</Fragment>;
};

export default GuestGuard;
```

### How to use it ?

```js routes.js
import { GuestGuard } from "components/auth";

const routes = () => {
  return [
    {
      path: "login",
      element: (
        <GuestGuard>
          <Login />
        </GuestGuard>
      ),
    },
  ];
};
```
